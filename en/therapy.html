            <br><br>
            <h3>How does EMDR work?</h3>
            <br>
            The therapist guides the client in concentrating on distressing memory or emotion while using eye movements called bilateral stimulation. The rapid eye movement occurs naturally during dreaming which is the time when a person’s mental processes any recent life events seem to speed the client’s movement through the healing process. The bilateral stimulation is used to stimulate one cerebral hemisphere at a time in a repeated way. Other types of bilateral simulations include tapping, sound, and the use of light.

            CBT is an intensive short-term and problem-oriented approach, which is a form of psychological treatment that focuses on challenging and changing distorted thoughts, dysfunctional emotions, and behaviors; the way people think influences the way they feel and these feelings impact people’s behavior. People naturally develop their own techniques and create their own solutions to adapt to their environment by using their conscious level and the metacognitive level to naturally grow, to learn better ways of coping, and become more effective in their lives. CBT focuses on finding the solutions at the present, instead of staying stuck, processing the root cause of where the problems are initiated.
