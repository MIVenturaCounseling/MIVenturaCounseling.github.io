                    I graduated from the University of North Texas-Dallas with a Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I have experience working with survivors of trauma, including sexual abuse, domestic violence, and incest recovery. I offer individual therapy to children, adolescents, individuals, and couples experiencing different difficulties. My Counseling services are offered in individual and group formats in English and Spanish. I am trained in the following client-centered counseling approaches and evidence-based approaches (scientific research): Child Centered Play Therapy-CCPT and Expressive Arts Therapy, Sandtray Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy-CBT, Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, I have completed Level 2 Training in Gottman Method Couples Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing-EMDR.
